## Using modern-cv {#using-modern-cv}

[moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv) is a standard \\(\LaTeX\\) package that you can find in many of your
latex distributions. I maintain a fork of it, to work with my use case at
<https://github.com/Titan-C/moderncv.git> Feel free to use any or even your
personal fork for your desired use case.

To configure the export for moderncv you need the addition options in your
org file.

```org
# CV theme - options include: 'casual' (default), 'classic', 'oldstyle' and 'banking'
#+CVSTYLE: banking
# CV color - options include: 'blue' (default), 'orange', 'green', 'red', 'purple', 'grey' and 'black'
#+CVCOLOR: green
```

When exporting you can call the following function to get the latex file.

```emacs-lisp
(org-export-to-file 'moderncv "moderncv.tex")
(org-latex-compile "moderncv.tex")
```

<object data="moderncv.org.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
<p>Alternative text - include a link <a href="moderncv.org.pdf">to the PDF!</a></p>
</object>


## Using alta-cv {#using-alta-cv}

[AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) is another project to generate a CV, you will need to install it
yourself. I maintain a fork too at <https://github.com/Titan-C/AltaCV.git>
because I need extra features and I encourage to use this fork on the
`sections` branch.

The style of this CV is more involved and you need some configuration in
your org file to get it to work. First define the margins, the large margin
to the right is to allow for a second column.

```org
#+LATEX_HEADER: \geometry{left=1cm,right=9cm,marginparwidth=6.8cm,marginparsep=1.2cm,top=1.25cm,bottom=1.25cm}
```

Content on the right column has the same structure of a org file, but you
need to enclose it in the `\marginpar{}` command as shown next.

```org
#+latex: \marginpar{
```

```org

```org

```

When exporting you can call the following function to get the latex file.

```emacs-lisp
(org-export-to-file 'altacv "altacv.tex")
(org-latex-compile "altacv.tex")
```

## Using AwesomeCV {#using-awesomecv}

[AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is another LaTeX template for producing nice-looking
CVs. In addition to the regular document attributes, the following are supported:

<div class="ox-hugo-table table table-striped">

these support additional property fields:

<div class="ox-hugo-table table table-striped">
<div></div>

| LABEL      | In `cvsubentry` environments, adds the given text to the left        |
|            | of the date range, can be used to add additional information         |
|            | to the entry.                                                        |

|            | exported output before the heading.                                  |
